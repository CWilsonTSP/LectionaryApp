# Lectionary App

This is an app created with the Expo client for React which pulls the Roman
Catholic lectionary from the [USCCB website](https://bible.usccb.org) and formats
it in a legible way,

This is a sort of remaking of my [Catholic App](https://github.com/CWilsonTSP/CatholicApp)
project, in which will only focus on [doing one thing well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well). 

## TODO

- Add a database for offline use
- Polish (well, create) the settings page
